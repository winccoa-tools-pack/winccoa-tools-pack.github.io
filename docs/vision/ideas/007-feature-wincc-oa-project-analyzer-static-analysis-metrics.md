**Description:**  
Create a CLI tool that scans WinCC OA projects and identifies structural issues and complexity metrics.

**Features:**  
- Detect unused panels, scripts, and data points  
- Identify cyclic dependencies  
- Naming convention violations  
- Complexity metrics for CTRL code  
- Duplicate code detection  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- CLI runs on any OA project folder  
- Outputs a detailed report in JSON and HTML  
- Supports at least 5 checks (unused files, naming, complexity, duplicates, dependencies)  
- Includes CI integration example  
- sonar-qube supported output
- output must contains fix-proposals
- the AI agents shall understand the output to support faster development (vs-code)
